    <h2>Welcome to cs132</h2>
    <p>CS132, 'Creating Modern Web Applications', is a spring semester course within the Brown CS department. The course has two tracks, one intended for CS concentrators, and one intended for non-Concentrators with previous design experience. It takes a holistic look at the process of developing Web Applications and aims to bring the students to a point of mastery of many of the most used web technologies, and development practices. The course includes a semester long group final project in which the students will be working with external companies, non-profits, and other organizations.</p>
    <p>The class will be held in CIT 165 at 11am to 11:50am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>

    <h2>Different Tracks</h2>
    <ul>
    <h3>Concentrator</h3>
    <li>If you have not taken CS32, it is <b>completely acceptable</b> to take the concentrator track. Students who have taken CS32 will have had experience in working on large-scale, open-ended projects. Such experience is not a prerequisite for the course. However, students should bear in mind that the concentrator track of CS132 may be an intense experience, especially for students without previous web background. Expect assignments to take upwards of 5-10 hours to complete.</li>
    <li>CS32 or CS33 are required, however, if you plan to count this course as a capstone.</li>
    <h3>Designer</h3>
    <li>The "Designers" track does involve some programming, but to a much smaller degree than the concentrator track. Computer Science concentrators (or potential concentrators) are <b>highly encouraged</b> to take the concentrator track; a student who has taken CS15/17/19 has the required rigorous programming background to succeed in that track. Please let us know if you have any other questions we can help address! The TAs can always be contacted by sending an email to <a href="mailto:cs132headtas@cs.brown.edu">cs132headtas@cs.brown.edu</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Student Final Projects</h2>
    <p>
      New this year, CS132 will allow a limited number of student projects. Student project proposals must be sent to cs132headtas@cs.brown.edu by Monday January 28th.
    </p>
    <p>
      A successful proposal is:
      <ul>
        <li>Well-defined: you should know not only the specifics of your project, but what technologies you might use.</li>
        <li>Well-scoped: the TAs have to believe you can complete it!</li>
        <li>Well-paced: you should have concrete milestones and checkpoints with your mentor TA throughout the semester.</li>
      </ul>
      If your proposal is accepted you will serve as a mentor for your project. This means you'll be responsbile for your project and the rest of your team. Other students will be able to join your project like any other (although if you have a group already we can take that into account).
    </p>

    <h2>2012-01-23: First Class!</h2>
    <p>The first class will be held in CIT 165 at 11am to 11:50am on Wednesday the 23rd.</p>
    <p>You can contact the Head TAs at: <a href="mailto:cs132headtas@cs.brown.edu">cs132headtas@cs.brown.edu</a></p>
